# This script contains helper functions

# Split entire data set into interested treatment group

# Difference of the mean outcome between treated and control group
# This is the classical way to find ATE in a randomized trial

# ATE with OLS for unconfoundedness assumption

# Calculate propensity score

# IPW to account for propensity
# Only requires propensity regression

# Plot the calibration of propensity score

# APIW for doubly robust
# Requires outcome regression and propensity regression
# Some freedom for what functions/models we use

# For ATE, show the results of different methods. Talk about how they compare to each other.
# Sensitivity analysis with data set reduction.
